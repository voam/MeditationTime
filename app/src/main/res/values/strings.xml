    <!-- Texts -->
    <string name="text_1">The term life energy refers to an energy that exists in all living beings. It is what supports the growth, healing and nurture of our physical, emotional and spiritual self. During meditation we connect with this nurturing energy which regenerates us and brings us into balance.</string>
    <string name="text_2">This life energy acts within the subtle system. The subtle system is parallel to the nervous system but is not physically manifested. It consists of three energy channels (left, right and centre) and energy centres which are found on the nerve plexuses along our spinal cord. The channels and energy centres each play different roles in maintaining our physical, emotional and spiritual health. When we are in meditation, our life energy passes through these channels and centres and nourishes them.</string>
    <string name="text_3">Meditation is a state in which our mind is completely without thoughts and our body is relaxed. We call this state thoughtless awareness (see below). It is not about focusing or concentrating on something in particular but freeing your mind and allowing your body to regenerate.</string>
    <string name="text_4">The state in which we are aware of our surroundings but are engaging in our thoughts. It does not mean we are not able to think but rather that we can stop all thoughts that are not allowing us to be in the present moment.</string>
    <string name="text_5">Nerve plexuses are networks of nerves along the spinal cord. The location of the energy centres in our subtle system correspond to the location of these nerve plexuses.</string>
    <string name="text_6">Energy centres are located in our subtle system and are found along our spinal cord at the nerve plexuses. Each centre is associated with various functions and qualities, an excess or lack of which can negatively affect the centre. Most of the problems we face in our daily lives can be traced back to an imbalance or blockage in one or more of these centres. Through meditation one can remove these blockages and strengthen the centres to bring oneself into balance.</string>
    <string name="text_7">This channel is found on the left side of our subtle system. It is associated with our past and emotions. When this channel is not stable this can result in lethargy, extreme emotions and/or mood swings. To strengthen this channel, meditation using the fire and earth elements is beneficial.</string>
    <string name="text_8">This channel is found on the right side of our subtle system. It is associated with action and planning and an excess of these can result in anger, irritability and stress. When this channel is overworked it gets overheated and we can cool it down by meditation with the water and air elements.</string>
    <string name="text_9">Your true self refers to the essence of who you are. When we meditate we aim to reconnect with this essence which can be clouded by social and cultural conditionings.</string>
